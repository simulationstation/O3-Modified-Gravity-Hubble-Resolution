# Forward Trajectory (Cross-Consistency)

This project currently has two separable questions:

- **Implications:** if GW luminosity distances follow modified propagation, how large is the **GR inference bias** in inferred cosmological anchors?
- **Physicality:** is the underlying GW propagation deviation itself **real physics** rather than residual catalogue/selection/waveform systematics?

The items below are the highest-value **cross-probe closure** tests that can be executed with **existing public data** (no O4/O5 required), ordered by how much they strengthen “global consistency” rather than siren-only consistency.

## 1) CMB Lensing Consistency (Geometry + Growth Proxy)

- **Goal:** check whether the propagation-informed MG history implies a lensing potential consistent with CMB lensing reconstructions (and whether modest MG response freedom can absorb any baseline suppression).
- **Can do now:** bandpower-level projection tests against **Planck 2018 lensing** (already in the Letter) and extend the same projection/refit approach to other public lensing products (e.g. ACT/SPT) using a matched “baseline projection + MG-aware response freedom” framework.
- **Referee-proof version:** embed the same propagation/Planck-mass evolution in a covariant MG/EFT model and refit lensing jointly with primary CMB and/or LSS so the lensing response is not an ad hoc freedom.

## 2) Primary CMB Anisotropies (Planck TT/TE/EE + lowE)

- **Goal:** demonstrate that the same MG degrees of freedom used to explain propagation do not spoil the primary anisotropy likelihood, and quantify how the inferred sound-horizon anchor shifts under a consistent MG model.
- **Can do now:** run a full Planck likelihood analysis under a chosen MG/EFT parameterisation (the key decision is committing to a covariant mapping from the propagation template to perturbation evolution).
- **Fast-but-weaker version:** compressed-parameter checks (derived constraints) can be used as a first pass, but will not substitute for a likelihood-level fit in peer review.

## 3) LSS Growth Closure (S8 / fσ8 / Lensing–Clustering)

- **Goal:** test whether the propagation-implied MG history produces acceptable structure growth and lensing deflection across redshift (i.e. whether “the same physics” that affects sirens is compatible with weak lensing + galaxy clustering + RSD).
- **Can do now:** compare to public weak-lensing and RSD constraints using either (i) compressed constraints as a quick screen or (ii) public likelihoods for a stronger test.
- **Referee-proof version:** fit LSS probes with the same MG parameterisation used for the CMB, enforcing a single consistent set of MG functions (no independent “dial” per probe).

## 4) Distance-Sector Closure (BAO + SNe) Under the Same Distance Law

- **Goal:** confirm that the late-time distance ladder implied by the propagation template is internally consistent once analysed under the same MG distance relation (and quantify how much “late-universe agreement” changes when GR is not assumed).
- **Can do now:** joint BAO+SNe fits under the MG distance relation, reporting shifts in inferred anchors and whether the transfer/bias terms are favoured once systematics are accounted for.
- **Referee-proof version:** a unified likelihood-level analysis that propagates the same MG background consistently through CMB-derived anchors and late-time distance data.

## 5) Early-Time Bounds (BBN / Recombination-Era Consistency)

- **Goal:** verify that the preferred propagation/Planck-mass evolution does not imply an unacceptable change in effective gravitational strength at BBN or recombination (cosmological early-time constraints; not Solar System / local tests).
- **Can do now:** once a specific $M_\\star(z)$ or equivalent EFT/MG function is adopted, compute whether $G_{\\rm eff}$ is effectively constant at BBN and early times and compare to standard cosmological bounds.
- **Referee-proof version:** the same covariant MG fit used for primary CMB should automatically enforce (or expose violations of) early-time constraints.
